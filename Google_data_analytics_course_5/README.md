# Course 5

In this course, called "Analyze data to answer questions"  I am focusing on basic SQL  queries that allow for data aggregation and analysis. Topics covered include aggregation statements, table joins, nested queries, and generation and usage of temporary tables. All code written for BigQuery, using either course supplied or BigQuery public datasets.
